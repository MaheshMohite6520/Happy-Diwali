# Happy Diwali Project

This is a simple project to celebrate the festival of Diwali using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a popular Hindu festival celebrated with great enthusiasm and joy. In this project, we will create a beautiful webpage that displays a Diwali greeting and some interactive elements.
